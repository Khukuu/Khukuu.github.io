			As you can probably tell, I don't have something for you this valetines day. In that I am deeply sorry, and thank you so much because you understand me, you are a very understanding person love and I love that about you. Happy Valetines day love! You are the one who fills my heart with joy and love every single day. There is no such day that I haven't felt loved by you, I always do! That is why I love you so much and you mean the world to me love. You are all I could ask for, that is why I am asking you now, even if I don't have much for you, even if I am so far away from you, even if I can only give you so much on this day, if you still don't have a valentine, will you be my valetine?
			<br>
			Love,
          	<br>Wubwub
